                    Wake up, sir. After several years of service to the monstrumologist, I approached him with the idea of recording in the interest of posterity, one or two of his more memorable case studies. And it came to pass that a messenger was sent out to each member of the family. Theoretically, Blue Sargent was probably going to kill one of these boys. 
                
                <span style="color: red">So what is it?</span>
                
                    Depending on where you began the story, it was a story about the women of 300 Fox Way. 
                
                <span style="color: red">It is, of course, a miracle.</span> 
                
                    Walk any path in Destiny’s garden, and you will be forced to choose, not once but many times. It was freezing in the churchyard, even before the dead arrived.
                
                <span style="color: red">Do you think this is actually real?</span>
                
                    And it came to pass that a messenger was sent out to each member of the family. I do not wish to remember these things. Do you think this is actually real? These are the secrets I have kept. There are tales that are told many times. 
                
                <span style="color: red">Wake up, sir.</span> 
                
                <span style="color: red">I reach for the end, though the end will not reach for me.</span> 
                
                    It is, of course, a miracle. While enthusiasts and detractors will continue to empty entire dictionaries attempting to describe or deride it, “authenticity” still remains the word most likely to stir a debate.
