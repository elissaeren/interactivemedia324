                    This is not for you. 
                
                <span style="color: red">Wake up, sir.</span>
                
                    After several years of service to the monstrumologist, I approached him with the idea of recording in the interest of posterity, one or two of his more memorable case studies. And it came to pass that a messenger was sent out to each member of the family. Theoretically, Blue Sargent was probably going to kill one of these boys. So what is it? 
                
                <span style="color: red">Depending on where you began the story, it was a story about the women of 300 Fox Way.</span>
                
                    It is, of course, a miracle. Walk any path in Destiny’s garden, and you will be forced to choose, not once but many times. 
                
                <span style="color: red">It was freezing in the churchyard, even before the dead arrived.</span> 
                
                    Do you think this is actually real? And it came to pass that a messenger was sent out to each member of the family. 
                
                <span style="color: red">I do not wish to remember these things.</span>
                
                <span style="color: red">Do you think this is actually real?</span> 
                
                    These are the secrets I have kept. There are tales that are told many times. Wake up, sir. I reach for the end, though the end will not reach for me. It is, of course, a miracle. While enthusiasts and detractors will continue to empty entire dictionaries attempting to describe or deride it, “authenticity” still remains the word most likely to stir a debate.
