                    After several years of service to the monstrumologist, I approached him with the idea of recording in the interest of posterity, one or two of his more memorable case studies. And it came to pass that a messenger was sent out to each member of the family. Theoretically, Blue Sargent was probably going to kill one of these boys. So what is it?

                    These are the secrets I have kept. There are tales that are told many times. Wake up, sir. I reach for the end, though the end will not reach for me. It is, of course, a miracle.
